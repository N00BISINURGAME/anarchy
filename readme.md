# Anarchy
An **open-source** league transactions bot made by Donovan#3771

## Prerequisites
This guide assumes that you know:
1) Javascript. This bot is programmed in Javascript, so it helps to know the language.
2) Basic server management. Since you are responsible for hosting the bot, you should know the basics of bot hosting like Sparkedhost.
3) Node.js, since this bot uses the Node.js runtime to handle packages.

## Getting started
Thanks for choosing to use Anarchy! To start things off, you should either do `git clone https://github.com/kongdonovan/anarchy.git` to get a local copy on your computer, or just download the source code using the github website.

After doing that, ensure you have Node.js installed and open up a terminal inside of the directory that all the bot code is in and run `npm install` to download all the packages this bot uses. You may also need to run `npm update`.

Then, go into `config.json` and input your bot's token and client ID into the specified fields. I will assume you know how to make a discord bot.

Then, run `npm start` and things should work!

## Hosting
For hosting, I recommend using Sparkedhost. They have a $1/month plan that should be just fine for this bot.
